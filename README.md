## Lesson 1

We are going to learn javascript. With it we can:
- write code that runs in our browser (doing this today)
- create servers
- create mobile apps
- write scripts for your computer

And it's all basically the same language.

We're going to start by getting our hands dirty as fast as possible -- I've emailed you all an HTML file. You can download it and save it wherever.

Now we're going to open the file in two places. If you double click it it should open in your browser. We also want to open it in a text editing program so we can see what's going on inside. There is a while wide world of text editors out there, but for today I want to show you what you can build with what;s already on your computer. So here;s textedit, set to plain text mode, and I'll just open the HTML file in here.

So this is an HTML file. You don't need to know what it stands for, everyone just calls it HTML, but it stands for HyperText Markup Language.

HTML is the backbone of any webpage. Today we have some HTML that basically does nothing except run our javascript for us. So for today we can leave html there, but we'll come back to it.

Now down here we have the script. I'd like to try to take a moment to read the code, and see if you can't figure out what this code is going to do.

Now, the fastest way to figure out what a script does is to run it: so open up the browser and refresh.

play the game for a moment

then break down the script

change the script to be a number guessing game
but uh oh it breaks because string !== number
we can discover this with LOGGING
, use <, >
