## lecture 2

### intro
1. getting set up
   1. we have VSCODE downloaded
   2. we have chrome downloaded
   3. we have last week's code
   4. we can open it in the browser like this
2. review last week's code
   1. HTML & JavaScript
   2. we learned a little bit of JavaScript
      1. how to leave a comment
      2. how to make a variable
      3. some examples of data (strings, numbers)
      4. how to compare variables/values/data
      5. some funky built-in functions (prompt and alert)
3. pause for questions
   1. previous week's work?
   2. VSCODE? 
   3. general Q's?
4. Now we take a look at this week's code
   1. builds on everything from last week
   2. we're going to run it
   3. then read it
5. more on Strings!
   1. string.length
   2. string.toLowerCase()
   3. string concatenation
6. while loop!
   1. looping is what computers are good at:
      1. doing something simple 
      2. really fast 
      3. a bunch of times
   2. the while syntax looks a lot like the if syntax
      1. we have a condition in parenthesis
      2. and a block of code to execute it the condition is true
      3. the while loop _keeps executing_
   3. infinite loops
      1. while loops are just one way of looping, and are actually considered dangerous
      2. what happens if the condition is always true?
         1. your program never stops
   4. continue and break
      1. continue means do this loop again
      2. break means exit this loop
7. homework
   1. write some code!
      1. create a variable, name it whatever you want, and give it a string for a value
      2. create another variable, call it `letterCount` or something, and set it to `0`
      3. using a while loop, and your variables, and possibly some _other_ variables, loop for the length of the string
         1. create a new error which mirrors the number positions of each letter in the string
         2. e.g. if your first variable's value was "blockhead"
            1. "blockhead" < input
            2. "012345678" < output
      4. hints:
         1. you will not need
